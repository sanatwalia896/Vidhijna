<GOAL>
Generate a high-quality summary of the web search results and keep it concise / related to the user topic.

<REQUIREMENTS>
When creating a NEW summary:
1. Highlight the most relevant information related to the user topic from the search results
2. Ensure a coherent flow of information

When EXTENDING an existing summary:                                                                                                                 
1. Read the existing summary and new search results carefully.                                                    
2. Compare the new information with the existing summary.                                                         
3. For each piece of new information:                                                                             
    a. If it's related to existing points, integrate it into the relevant paragraph.                               
    b. If it's entirely new but relevant, add a new paragraph with a smooth transition.                            
    c. If it's not relevant to the user topic, skip it.
